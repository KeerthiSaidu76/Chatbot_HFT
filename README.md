Notes
Here’s a ready-to-use README.md for your project:
Local CLI Chatbot (Hugging Face)
This is a simple command-line chatbot built using Hugging Face’s transformers.
It loads a pretrained model (distilgpt2 by default), keeps track of recent conversation turns, and generates replies interactively.

Features
1. Uses Hugging Face transformers (distilgpt2 by default).
2. Supports sliding window memory (remembers last N turns).
3. Configurable parameters:
--max_new_tokens: length of generated reply
--temperature: creativity
--top_p: nucleus sampling
--greedy: deterministic decoding
4. Works on CPU or GPU (if available).
5. CLI interface for chatting.

Installation
1. Clone the repo or download files:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-cli.git
cd chatbot-cli
2. Install dependencies:
pip install torch transformers
(If you want the Hugging Face datasets library too:)
pip install datasets

Usage
Run the chatbot from terminal:
python interface.py

Optional arguments:
python interface.py --model_id distilgpt2 --max_turns 5 --max_new_tokens 128 --temperature 0.7 --top_p 0.9

Example
Loading model distilgpt2...
Ready. Type your messages. Type /exit to quit.
You: hi
Bot: Hello! How are you?
You: what is AI?
Bot: AI stands for artificial intelligence, a field of computer science.
To exit:
/exit

Notes
The default model (distilgpt2) is small and may give random or funny outputs.
For better quality, you can change --model_id to another Hugging Face model (e.g., "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium").
Large models will take longer to download.
